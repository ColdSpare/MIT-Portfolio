# Generator-Plugin

## For MIT Maker Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my Generator Plugin project, a Minecraft server plugin designed to optimize player interactions with generators. 
- Generators are blocks that produce virtual items over time, which players can sell for in-game currency to progress within the server's economy.

- The main Java source code is located in the `src/main` directory.
- A detailed code outline is provided as a PDF in my SlideRoom portfolio submission (highly recommendedâ€”plus I spent a lot of time on it!).

Thank you for reviewing my work!
